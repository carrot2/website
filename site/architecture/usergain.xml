        <p>
        A number of scientific papers concerning search results processing have been published.
        Each and every author had to go through the same tedious (and quite fruitless) tasks
        of building a search engine wrapper, incorporating stemming/ light language processing
        algorithms, and finally displaying a result of the algorithm in some form.
        </p>

        <p>
        In our opinion this is highly reduntant work and most of the components (wrappers, processing,
        displaying) can be reused. Thus, we think <carrot-text/> gives a number of possible 
        shortcuts for those willing to work with search result clustering or any other form
        of textual data processing (we envision some applications of information retrieval could also
        applied easily using the architecture we proposed):
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reusable components</b> - for a certain application, a standard data exchange
            format can be proposed, which makes components using this format replaceable and reusable.
            We proposed such data exchange format for application in search results clustering -- 
            an XML-based query and search result.
            </li>
            <li><b>Start your experiments fast</b> - because <carrot-text/> comes with a set of template
            component classes and utilities in Java, a researches can almost immediately set up his/ her own
            component within the framework and start working on specific thing he wants to deal with.
            </li>
            <li><b>OpenSource</b> - <carrot-text/> is an open source initiative. It is available free of charge
            and the code base can be modified to be adjusted to one's needs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        Text clustering and especially search results clustering is a hot topic nowadays.
        <carrot-text/> provides a production-ready infrastructure and quality for such applications
        at the very convenient legal terms of the BSD license. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We are very proud of our open source offering -- it meets the industry standards
        concerning code quality and stability. If 
        additional performance or tuning expertise is needed, a spin-off company <a href="http://www.carrot-search.com">Carrot
        Search</a> provides both (a commercial clustering component seamlessly integrating with the open source framework
        and consulting/ tuning services).
