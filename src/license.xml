      <h2>In simple words</h2>
      You can use and distribute Carrot<sup>2</sup> in any kind of project
      (Open Source, research, commercial) as long as you retain the license text in your
      binary distribution. <br /><br />
      It'd be great if you let us know about your
      project and/or <a content="faq" anchor="acknowledging">acknowledged</a>
      the use of Carrot<sup>2</sup> on your project's website or documentation.
      It's optional, but keeps us motivated :-)
