          The 2.1 release of <c2 /> comes with a completely new application,
          the Document Clustering Server (DCS). The DCS exposes <c2 />'s
          clustering capabilities as an HTTP/REST or XML/RPC service. For the
          former, XML and JSON data formats are supported. Additionally, the
          DCS contains a simple command line application for calling <c2 />
          clustering in batch mode.
