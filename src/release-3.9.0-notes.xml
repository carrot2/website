      The 3.9.0 release updates Lucene and other library
      dependencies, abandons Flash-based visualizations migrating
      to HTML5-only equivalents and provides an aggregate set of
      of bug fixes from previous minor releases.

        <td class="head">
          HTML5 visualizations replace Flash
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>
            Flash visualizations are gone from the Workbench and the web application,
            replaced by HTML5-based, shiny new visualizations from Carrot Search.
            This also means that Workbench and the webapp will require a modern browser
            for full functionality (IE9+, a recent version of Chrome or Firefox).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The update comes with a few minor improvements, such as multiple-cluster selection
            in the Web application (and the Workbench). Try it by selecting clusters while
            holding the the control (or the Mac) key.
