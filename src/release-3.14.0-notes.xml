      The 3.14.0 release upgrades the underlying RCP platform used in the
      Workbench and provides support for high-DPI devices. A number of 
      smaller improvements have been folded into
      this release, including embedding snowball stemmers, updating PubMed
      links to https (as per official recommendation) and adjusting various
      logs to include more contextual information.

          <p>
             The Workbench has been upgraded to Eclipse RCP Neon release. This
             provides support for high-resolution displays, improved stability
             and support for SWT-AWT bridge, which makes Aduna visualization
             work again on Macs.
          </p>

          <p>
             This upgrade requires Java 1.8. This affects Workbench only, the rest
             of the framework is still on 1.7.
          </p>
          
          <p>
             Binary builds of Workbench will be available for 64-bit platforms only,
             32-bits can be built from source.
          </p>
          
          <p>
             Workbench version for MacOSX has been reshaped to better reflect application
             structure on that operating system.
