          <p>
             Microsoft Bing API V2 is officially deprecated and will be removed. A new
             API (cognitive services) replaces it entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
             This upgrade removes code for old Bing API V2 and adds new Bing API V5 
             support. Note that the document source class and attributes are different;
             the new document source is called <code>org.carrot2.source.microsoft.v5.Bing5DocumentSource</code>
             for web search results and <code>org.carrot2.source.microsoft.v5.Bing5NewsDocumentSource</code>
             for news results. Image search document source has been removed without a replacement.
          </p>
          
          <p>
             A new API key is required to use these document inputs. 
             <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis">Refer to Microsoft's on-line help</a> 
             on how to issue API keys. There is a monthly free query limit.

             A few minor tweaks have been made internally (switching to NIO in a few places,
             upgrading testing libraries).
