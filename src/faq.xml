      <div class="q">Can I use Carrot<sup>2</sup> in a commercial project?</div>
      <div class="a">
        Yes. The only requirement is that you properly acknowledge the use of
        Carrot<sup>2</sup> (on the project's website and documentation) and let
        us know about your project. Please also remember to read the <a
        content="license">license</a>.

    <div class="qa">
      <div class="q">Can Carrot<sup>2</sup> crawl my website?</div>
      <div class="a">
        No. Carrot<sup>2</sup> can add clustering of search results to an
        existing search engine. You can use an Open Source project called <a
        href="http://www.nutch.org">Nutch</a> to crawl your website. Nutch has
        a Carrot<sup>2</sup>-based search clustering plugin, so you'll get all
        crawling, searching and clustering in one piece. If you need help
        with any of these, please <a content="support">contact us</a>.

    <div class="qa">
      <div class="q">How can I integrate Carrot<sup>2</sup> with my Web site/ software?</div>
      <div class="a">
        <p>
        Such an integration depends on what existing infrastructure is already available in your project. Carrot<sup>2</sup>
        requires a <emph>feed</emph> of documents (search results), so typically you'll need a search engine
        that crawls your site. Such an engine can be indeed local to your Web site (proprietary solutions in intranets, 
        search engines built on top of <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/">Nutch</a> or <a href="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://dig</a>),
        but it can as well be a global search engine with searches restricted to your domain (Google, Yahoo).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Once a search engine is available, the integration depends on the
        technology your site/ software uses for rendering the user interface
        (or more accurately: for implementing application logic). Software
        written in Java can use Carrot<sup>2</sup> directly in a way that is
        shown in the end-to-end <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/carrot2/trunk/carrot2/applications/carrot2-demo-api-example/src/org/carrot2/apiexample/Example.java?view=markup">example
        code</a> (<a href="http://project.carrot2.org/api/org/carrot2/apiexample/Example.html">JavaDoc</a>).
        Sites written in Perl, PHP, .NET and other languages can utilize
        different forms of data exchange available for Carrot<sup>2</sup>:
        SOAP, XML-RPC and even plain HTTP POST that accepts and returns data
        encoded in XML. Finally, in some cases you might want to re-use and
        customize (through XSLT) some bits of Carrot<sup>2</sup>'s <carrot2-webapp-link>web
        application</carrot2-webapp-link> (located in the <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/carrot2/trunk/carrot2/applications/carrot2-demo-webapp/"><span
        class="c2element">carrot2/applications/carrot2-demo-webapp</span></a>
        folder of the source repository) to e.g. visualize clusters.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Note that Carrot<sup>2</sup> integration requires some Java development
        skills and familiarity with Java development tools (Eclipse, Apache
        ANT). The example code and JUnit tests available in the open source project demonstrate
        various ways of using Carrot<sup>2</sup>. The project's <a
        href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/carrot2-developers">mailing
        list</a> can also be of some help if you get stuck someplace.
        We have also prepared a step-by-step example of using the Carrot<sup>2</sup> API directly, it is
        available in the <a href="https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/carrot2/trunk/carrot2/applications/carrot2-demo-api-example/src/org/carrot2/apiexample/Example.java">source code repository</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>If you'd rather pay for having the integration done quickly and professionally, <a href="http://www.carrot-search.com">Carrot Search</a>
        provides consulting services (paid approximately 70 USD per hour).
