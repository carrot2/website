    <faq id="crawling">
      <question>Can <c2 /> crawl my website?</question>
      <answer>
        No. <c2 /> can add clustering of search results to an
        existing search engine. You can use an Open Source project called <a
        href="http://www.nutch.org">Nutch</a> to crawl your website. Nutch has
        a <c2 />-based search clustering plugin, so you'll get all
        crawling, searching and clustering in one piece. If you need help
        with any of these, please <a content="contact">contact us</a>.

    <faq id="other-uses">
      <question>Can I use <c2 /> to cluster something else than search results?</question>
      <answer>
        Absolutely. <c2 /> came about as a framework for building search results clustering
        engines but its algorithms should successfully cluster up to about a thousand
        text documents, a few paragraphs each. 
      </answer>
    </faq>

    <faq id="classification">
      <question>Can I force <c2 /> to cluster my documents to some predefined clusters / labels?</question>
      <answer>
        No. Assigning documents to a set of predefined categories is a problem called
        text classification / categorization and <c2 /> was not designed to solve it.
        For text classification components you may want to see the 
        <a href="http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/">LingPipe project</a>.
      </answer>
    </faq>

    <faq id="scalability">
      <question>How does <c2 /> clustering scale with respect to the number and length of documents?</question>
      <answer>
        The most important characteristic of <c2 /> algorithms to keep in mind
        is that they perform in-memory clustering. For this reason, as a rule of thumb, <c2 /> should
        successfully deal with up to a thousand of documents, a few paragraphs each.
        For algorithms designed to process millions of documents, you may want to check 
        out the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/">Mahout project</a>.

    <faq id="clustering-without-query">
      <question>Can I perform clustering without specifying the query?</question>
      <answer>
        Yes. While the query is usually very helpful to get rid of the obvious
        meanings related to the documents in the search results set, it is not
        obligatory -- the clustering algorithms will cope without the query.

    <faq id="commercial">
      <question>Can I use <c2 /> in a commercial project?</question>

      <answer>
        Please put a statement equivalent to "This product includes software
        developed by the Carrot2 Project" on your site and link it to
        <c2 />'s website (<a
