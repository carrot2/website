      The 3.4.1 release introduces a compatibility package for running newer versions
      of <c2 /> in Apache Solr 1.4.x and fixes an issue with clustering quality in Java 
      and C# API and a number of other minor problems.

          Solr 1.4.x comes with built-in search results clustering based on version 3.1.0 of <c2 />.
          Newer versions of <c2 /> can now be used with Solr 1.4.x through the

          Fix for degraded clustering quality in Java and C# API

            The default configurations of version 3.4.0 of <c2 /> Java
            and C# API perform clustering without stemming, which
            may lead to degraded clustering quality. A drop-in upgrade from an
            earlier release to release 3.4.0 of <c2 /> JAR would also result in
            a similar clustering quality decrease.         
          </p>

          <p>
            Release 3.4.1 addresses this issue: Java and C# API perform
            clustering using the appropriate stemming engine, a drop-in upgrade
            of the <c2 /> JAR does not cause the clustering quality decrease.
          </p>

            Other tools, including <c2 /> Document Clustering Workbench,
            <c2 /> Document Clustering Server, <c2 /> Command Line Interface,
            <c2 /> Web Application and the Solr clustering component were not
            affected by this issue. For more details and a workaround for
            <c2 /> 1.4.0, please see <a href="http://issues.carrot2.org/browse/CARROT-723">CARROT-723</a>.
