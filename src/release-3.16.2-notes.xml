          <p>
             Jackson library has been upgraded to version 2.9.9. Simple-xml library has been repackaged
             and now comes in a "safe" variant that prevents XXE attacks. <strong>If you use the DCS, please
             upgrade immediately.</strong>

        <td>
          <p>
             Java 1.8 is required for this release to work. Note that the Workbench requires exactly
             Java 1.8 (it will not work with any newer Java version).
