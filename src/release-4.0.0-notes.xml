             Carrot<sup>2</sup> version 4.0.0 comes with a redesigned, modernized and
             simplified API. Please take a look at the <a href="https://carrot2.github.io/release/4.0.0/doc/">
             new documentation</a> and examples
             as they provide the best guidance on porting existing code (or writing new code)

          <p>
             A number of things have been removed in order to simplify the project
             and its code base (as well as downstream user code): controllers, document
             sources. Sadly, this also includes the
             Workbench, for which there is currently no replacement. We're considering options
             on how to revive a tuning/ demo application which could serve the needs 
             Workbench fulfilled previously.
