    <faq id="for-start">
      <question>I am planning to start using <c2 />, should I choose 2.x or the 3.0 RC1 version?</question>
      <answer>
        By all means, start with the 3.0 RC1 version. It offers <head-javadoc-link>much simpler
        Java API</head-javadoc-link>, better accompanying applications and <head-manual-link>documentation</head-manual-link>. The only
        reason you might want to stick with the 2.x line is when your software
        must run under JDK 1.4, which <c2 /> v3.0 does not support.

    <faq id="should-i-migrate">
      <question>Should I migrate my 2.x-based software to the 3.0 version?</question>
      <answer>
        If you'd like to take advantage of the improved clustering quality in version 3.0
        and new features planned for further 3.x releases, you should migrate.

    <faq id="migration">
      <question>How do I migrate my 2.x-based software to the 3.0 version?</question>
      <answer>
        If you are using <c2 /> Java API, download the 
        <head-java-api-download-link>3.0 release Java API package</head-java-api-download-link>
        and replace the calls to <c2 /> API in your software where appropriate. If you are using
        the Document Clustering Server (DCS), download the 
        <head-dcs-download-link>3.0 release DCS</head-dcs-download-link> run your
        software against it. The changes in the DCS API were very minor, mainly to introduce
        consistent parameter naming.

    <faq id="2x-status">
      <question>What will be the status of the 2.x version when 3.0 is officially released?</question>
      <answer>
        After the official release of <c2 /> v3.0, the 2.x line will enter the
        maintenance mode with all new features being added to the 3.x line and
        the 2.x line being limited to bug fixes only.
